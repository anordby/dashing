# dashing

I am using the Dashing.io dashboard framework a lot, and like Ruby.
Perhaps one day I will need to use Smashing instead?

In this repository I will put mainly examples of data feeding to Dashing,
scripts that fetch and post data between various systems.

I often use nick123pig's dashing-table
(https://github.com/nick123pig/dashing-table) to post densely populated
data in tables.
